# Form with Database using Hibernate and JPA

This is a small project that demonstrates the use of Hibernate and the JPA (Java Persistence API) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data in a database.

## Requirements

Before running the program, make sure you have met the following requirements:

1. Have an IDE installed to facilitate editing the `persistence.xml` file.
2. Configure the connection to a PostgreSQL database in the `persistence.xml` file.

## Features

The project offers the following features:

- Registration of new users.
- Querying information of registered users.
- Updating data of an existing user.
- Deleting a user from the database.

## Database Configuration

For the program to work correctly, you must edit the `persistence.xml` file in your IDE and configure the connection information to the PostgreSQL database, as well as the specific Hibernate properties.

## Note

This project uses Hibernate as an object-relational mapping tool and the JPA API to perform operations on the database. It is an educational example of how to implement CRUD operations with these technologies.

**Note:** This project was developed for educational and learning purposes.
